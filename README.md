# VScode_Colab_Download
Download Helper for Colab / VS Code Notebooks

This small utility provides a simple way to generate clickable download links for files created inside a notebook environment—such as Google Colab or the VS Code Jupyter extension.
It embeds the file directly into an HTML <a> tag using Base64 encoding, allowing you to download files even when the environment does not expose a traditional filesystem UI.

✨ Features

Create instant download links for any file in the runtime.

Works in Google Colab, VS Code Jupyter, and any IPython notebook environment.

No external dependencies.

Handy for exporting logs, model outputs, generated files, etc.
